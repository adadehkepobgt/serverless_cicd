Here’s how you can prepare for your meeting with Stefan and structure it effectively:

---

### 1. **Starting the Meeting**
- **Introduce Yourself** (if you haven’t already in the chat):  
  "Hi Stefan, thanks again for taking the time to chat with me today. I’m Hannah, currently interning with the infrastructure team in Hong Kong, and I’m excited to learn more about your work with serverless Lambda applications."  

- **Set the Agenda:**  
  "I’d like to focus on understanding how deployments are currently being handled for serverless Lambda applications, what challenges you and your team face, and explore how a CI/CD pipeline might help address those pain points. Does that sound good to you?"

---

### 2. **Discussion Points**
Here are some key questions and areas you can explore during the meeting:

#### a) **Current Deployment Process**
- "Could you walk me through how deployments to development, UAT, and production environments are currently handled for your serverless Lambda applications?"
- "What tools or scripts are you using for these deployments right now?"

#### b) **Challenges and Pain Points**
- "What challenges or bottlenecks have you or your team faced while deploying serverless Lambda applications?"  
  *(e.g., manual processes, errors during deployment, lack of rollback mechanisms, etc.)*
- "How do you ensure consistency and reliability across different environments (dev, UAT, prod)?"

#### c) **Future Improvements**
- "Are there any specific improvements you’d like to see in your deployment process?"  
- "What features or functionality would you expect from a CI/CD pipeline for serverless Lambda applications?"

#### d) **Collaboration with the Cloud Team**
- "You mentioned the cloud team helped with Terraform for transitioning from UAT to prod. Could you share more about how Terraform fits into your current workflow?"
- "Do you think Terraform could be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline, or are there any gaps it doesn’t address?"

---

### 3. **Closing the Meeting**
- **Summarize Key Takeaways:**  
  "Thanks so much for sharing your insights, Stefan. Just to summarize, I’ve noted [brief summary of key challenges, tools, and ideas discussed]."  

- **Next Steps:**  
  "Based on what we discussed, I’ll start looking into [specific tools/solutions] and draft a proposal for a CI/CD pipeline. If it’s okay, I’d love to follow up with you if I have any further questions or ideas to share."  

- **Gratitude:**  
  "Thanks again for your time and for walking me through these details—it’s been really helpful!"

---

### 4. **Additional Preparation**
- Review the Confluence documentation and any Jira tickets Stefan shared to familiarize yourself with their current process and tools.
- Research common CI/CD tools for serverless applications (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Terraform, Serverless Framework).
- Have a notebook or document ready to jot down any specific insights or suggestions Stefan provides.

This structure will help you stay organized, build rapport, and gather the information you need effectively. Good luck!

help me prepare the meeting with stefan, note that i need to make a ci/cd pipeline for serverless lambda application and I want to know the pain points of ppl doing dev and prod for serverless lambda application and more imporantly how are they doing the deployment right now, also since i dont know him how should i start the meeting
