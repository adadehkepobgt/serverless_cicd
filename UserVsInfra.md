## Pipeline Implementation Requirements

### **Developer (User) Responsibilities**

**What Developers Need to Do:**
• **Write Unit Tests** - Create comprehensive unit tests for all Lambda functions using standard testing frameworks (pytest, Jest, JUnit)
• **Follow Testing Standards** - Ensure unit tests cover business logic, error handling, and edge cases with proper mocking of AWS services

**What Developers Can Do:**
• **Commit Code Normally** - Push code to Bitbucket repository as usual; pipeline automatically triggers both unit and integration testing
• **Monitor Test Results** - View test results and logs through Jenkins dashboard; receive notifications if tests fail

### **Infrastructure Team (One-Time Setup)**

**Initial Setup Requirements:**
• **Jenkins Configuration** - Install and configure Jenkins with AWS CLI plugins and Terraform integration
• **Cross-Account IAM Roles** - Create deployment roles in target AWS accounts with trust relationships to Jenkins account
• **Terraform Templates** - Develop reusable Terraform modules for common AWS resources (Lambda, S3, API Gateway)
• **Pipeline Scripts** - Create Jenkins pipeline templates with role assumption logic and testing workflows
• **Bitbucket Integration** - Configure webhooks and repository access for automatic pipeline triggering

### **Reusability Across Projects**

**No Changes Needed Per Project:**
• **Jenkins Infrastructure** - Same Jenkins instance serves all projects
• **Cross-Account Roles** - Same IAM roles work for all deployments to same target accounts
• **Pipeline Framework** - Core pipeline logic (role assumption, Terraform execution, testing workflow) remains identical

**Project-Specific Customization:**
• **Terraform Configuration** - Each project provides its own `.tf` files defining specific resources (Lambda functions, S3 buckets, etc.)
• **Test Scripts** - Project-specific unit tests and integration test scenarios
• **Environment Variables** - Project-specific configuration values (function names, bucket names, etc.)

### **Scalability Model**

**One-Time Investment:**
✅ Jenkins setup and AWS integration  
✅ Cross-account security configuration  
✅ Pipeline template development  
✅ Documentation and training materials  

**Per-Project Effort:**
• Copy pipeline template to new repository
• Customize Terraform files for project resources
• Write project-specific unit and integration tests
• Configure project-specific environment variables

**Result:** After initial setup, onboarding new projects takes **hours, not weeks** - infrastructure team provides the framework, development teams focus on their application logic and tests.

The infrastructure investment pays dividends across multiple projects since the core pipeline, security model, and deployment framework remain consistent regardless of the specific AWS resources each project uses.
