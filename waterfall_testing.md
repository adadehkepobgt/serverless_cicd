## It's a **Waterfall/Sequential Process**, NOT Parallel

### **Correct Sequence:**
```
Unit Testing → Integration Testing → Terraform Plan
```

### **Why Sequential (Not Parallel):**

#### **1. Unit Testing MUST Pass First**
- If unit tests fail, there's no point running integration tests
- Integration tests are expensive (use real AWS resources)
- Don't waste time/resources on broken code

#### **2. Integration Testing MUST Pass Before Deployment**
- If integration tests fail, the Lambda function has issues with AWS services
- No point creating a Terraform plan for broken functionality
- Terraform plan is only useful if the code actually works

#### **3. Terraform Plan Only After Code Validation**
- Terraform plan shows what infrastructure changes will be made
- Only create deployment plans for code that passed all tests
- Saves time and avoids unnecessary infrastructure planning

### **Stage Dependencies:**
- **Unit Tests Fail** → Stop pipeline, don't run integration tests
- **Integration Tests Fail** → Stop pipeline, don't create Terraform plan
- **All Tests Pass** → Proceed to Terraform plan and deployment

### **Update Your Diagram:**
Instead of showing them in a box together, show them as sequential steps:

```
Jenkins Pipeline:
Unit Testing → Integration Testing → Terraform Plan → Staging → Approval → Production
```

### **Time Benefits of Sequential:**
- **Fast feedback**: Unit tests fail in 30 seconds, you know immediately
- **Resource efficiency**: Don't waste AWS resources on broken code
- **Logical flow**: Each stage validates the next stage makes sense

This sequential approach is standard CI/CD practice - fail fast and don't waste resources on code that's already known to be broken.
